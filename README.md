# Toolbox

A cross platform GUI application to help with common development tasks.

Not a good replacement for unix knowledge.

Built using [tauri](https://tauri.studio/) and [svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

This project is cool because it is built using web stack, is cross platform and the executable is (at the time of writing) < 10MB uncompressed and it uses < 20MB of ram on my linux machine.

Strongly influenced by [dev tools on mac](https://devutils.app/) and [dev toys for windows](https://devtoys.app/).
